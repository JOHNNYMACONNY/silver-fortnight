### 8. Firestore Index Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Test:** Monitor console for errors  
**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED - Indexes Building

**Errors Found:**
```
Error: The query requires an index. That index is currently being built.
```

**Missing Indexes Added:**
1. `challenges` collection - status, type, createdAt
2. `challenges` collection - status, type, endDate
3. `challenges` collection - difficulty, status, participantCount
4. `userChallenges` collection - status, userId, lastActivityAt
5. `userChallenges` collection - userId, lastActivityAt

**File Modified:**
- `/firestore.indexes.json` - Added 5 new composite indexes

**Status:**
- Indexes submitted to Firebase
- Firebase currently building indexes
- Queries will work once indexes complete (typically 5-15 minutes)

**Impact:**
- Some challenge filtering/sorting queries fail
- Featured challenges section shows empty
- Recommended challenges section shows empty
- Challenge calendar fails to load

**Resolution:**
- Wait for indexes to finish building
- Re-test affected features

---

### 9. Celebration Modal ‚ùå

**Test:** Check if celebration modal appears on completion  
**Status:** FAIL - Modal did not appear

**Expected Behavior:**
- Confetti animation
- XP counter animation
- Achievement badges display
- Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds

**Actual Behavior:**
- No modal displayed
- Silent completion

**Possible Causes:**
- Modal trigger not implemented in completion flow
- Modal component not imported
- Condition not met for modal display

**Recommendation:**
- Investigate `RewardCelebrationModal.tsx` integration
- Check if modal is called after successful completion
- Verify reward data is passed to modal

---

### 10. XP Award Verification ‚è≥

**Test:** Verify XP was awarded to user  
**Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Expected:**
- Base XP: 100 (beginner difficulty)

  - Early completion: up to +25% (25 XP)
  - First attempt: +15% (15 XP)
  - Total possible: up to 190 XP

**To Verify:**
- Check `userXP` collection for user document
- Check `xpTransactions` collection for challenge completion entry
- Verify XP total in user profile
- Check leaderboard update

**Recommendation:**
- Navigate to user profile to check XP total
- Query Firestore for xpTransactions
- Verify leaderboard standings

## Additional Bugs Found

### Bug #1: User Streak Update Error
