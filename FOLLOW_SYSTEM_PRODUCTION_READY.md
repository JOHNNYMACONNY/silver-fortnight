# Follow System - Production Ready Documentation

**Last Updated**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION**  
**Production URL**: https://tradeya-45ede.web.app

---

## Quick Summary

The real-time follower count feature is **fully working** on Firebase Spark (free) plan:
- ✅ Follow/Unfollow/Re-follow - complete cycle tested
- ✅ Real-time accurate follower counts
- ✅ No Cloud Functions required
- ✅ Security hardened (forgery impossible)
- ✅ Deployed to production

---

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions (`src/services/leaderboards.ts`)

**`followUser(followerId, followingId)`** - Creates follow relationship
- Creates document in `userFollows` collection
- Triggers reputation recomputation
- Sends notification to followed user

**`unfollowUser(followerId, followingId)`** - Removes follow relationship
- **Hard deletes** document (prevents re-follow bug!)
- Triggers reputation recomputation

**`checkIsFollowing(followerId, followingId)`** - Checks follow status
- Queries `userFollows` collection
- Returns boolean

**`calculateFollowerCount(userId)`** - Real-time follower calculation
- Queries `userFollows` WHERE `followingId == userId`
- Returns accurate count

**`calculateFollowingCount(userId)`** - Real-time following calculation
- Queries `userFollows` WHERE `followerId == userId`
- Returns accurate count

**`getUserSocialStats(userId)`** - Gets social stats with real-time counts
- Calculates follower/following counts from `userFollows` collection
- Returns cached `socialStats` with overridden real-time counts
- No cross-user document creation (prevents permission errors)

### UI Integration (`src/components/features/SocialFeatures.tsx`)

- Checks follow status on component mount
- Displays accurate follower/following counts
- Follow button shows correct state ("Follow" or "Following")
- Refreshes counts after follow/unfollow actions

---

## Security

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
match /socialStats/{userId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow create, update: if isAuthenticated() && (
    userId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin()
  );
  allow delete: if isAdmin();
}

match /userFollows/{followId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow create: if isAuthenticated() && (
    request.resource.data.followerId == request.auth.uid
  );
  allow update, delete: if isAuthenticated() && (
    resource.data.followerId == request.auth.uid || isAdmin()
  );
}
```

### Attack Vectors Blocked
- ❌ Follower count forgery (users can only update their own `socialStats`)
- ❌ Unauthorized follow relationships (users can only create follows as themselves)
- ❌ Stale data (real-time calculation from source of truth)

---

## Performance

**Firestore Reads Per Profile View**: 2-3 reads
- 1 read for `calculateFollowerCount()` query
- 1 read for `calculateFollowingCount()` query  
- 1 read for `socialStats` document (if exists)

**Spark Plan Capacity**: ~16,666 profile views/day (50,000 reads/day limit)

**Optimization**: Counts are calculated in parallel for better performance

---

## Critical Bug Fix

**Problem**: Re-follow failed with "Already following" error  
**Root Cause**: Soft delete left stale `deletedAt` records  
**Solution**: Changed to hard delete using `deleteDoc()`  
**Verification**: Complete follow→unfollow→re-follow cycle tested and working

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`src/services/__tests__/leaderboards.follow.test.ts`)
- ✅ 9 tests passing
- Validates hard delete implementation
- Tests input validation
- Verifies re-follow cycle

### Integration Tests (`src/components/features/__tests__/SocialFeatures.follow.test.tsx`)
- ✅ 10 tests passing
- Tests component state management
- Validates follow/unfollow cycle
- Checks error handling

### Browser Tests (Production Verified)
- ✅ Follow user → Button: "Following", Count: 0→1
- ✅ Unfollow user → Button: "Follow", Count: 1→0
- ✅ Re-follow user → Button: "Following", Count: 0→1 (NO ERRORS!)

---

## Deployment

**Deployed Components**:
- ✅ Frontend code (Firebase Hosting)
- ✅ Firestore security rules
- ✅ Firestore indexes (via Firebase Console)

**Not Deployed** (Blaze plan required):
- ⏸️ Cloud Functions (`functions/src/index.ts` - optional enhancement)

---

## Required Firestore Indexes

Already deployed via Firebase Console:

1. **`userFollows` (followerId + followingId)**
   - Purpose: Check if user is following another user
   - Query: `WHERE followerId == X AND followingId == Y`

2. **`userFollows` (followingId + createdAt)**
   - Purpose: Get follower list
   - Query: `WHERE followingId == X ORDER BY createdAt DESC`

3. **`userFollows` (followerId + createdAt)**
   - Purpose: Get following list
   - Query: `WHERE followerId == X ORDER BY createdAt DESC`

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Follower/Following List Modal** - Show who's following/followed
2. **Client-Side Caching** - Cache counts for 5 minutes (reduce reads)
3. **Cloud Functions** - Auto-update `socialStats` (requires Blaze plan upgrade)
4. **Mutual Followers Badge** - Show "Follows you" badge

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Follow button doesn't update
**Solution**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cached state

### Issue: Follower count seems wrong
**Solution**: Counts are calculated from `userFollows` collection - verify database state

### Issue: "Already following" error
**Solution**: This should not happen anymore with hard delete. If it does, check that `deleteDoc` is imported and used in `unfollowUser()`
