## ‚úÖ Test Results

### Test 1: Follow User

**Action**: Click "Follow" button on T-Lok's profile  
**Expected**: Button changes to "Following", follower count increments  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **PASS**

**Details:**
- Button text changed from "Follow" to "Following"
- Follower count updated from 0 to 1
- Database record created in `userFollows` collection
- No errors in console

**Database Verification:**
```yaml
Document: userFollows/aUfBGJbD0zX7V5V9y56T
followerId: TozfQg0dAHe4ToLyiSnkDqe3ECj2 (John)
followingId: OISHCcKZvUYdt9HTxLuvZLh3YDx2 (T-Lok)
createdAt: 2025-10-30T03:38:50.982Z
```

### Test 2: Unfollow User

**Action**: Click "Following" button (to unfollow)  
**Expected**: Button changes to "Follow", follower count decrements  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **PASS**

**Details:**
- Button text changed from "Following" to "Follow"
- Follower count updated from 1 to 0
- Database record deleted (hard delete confirmed)
- No errors in console

**Database Verification:**
```
Query for follow relationship: EMPTY (document was deleted)
```

### Test 3: Re-Follow User (CRITICAL BUG FIX)

**Action**: Click "Follow" button again (after unfollowing)  
**Expected**: Button changes to "Following", follower count increments, NO "Already following" error  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **PASS** (This was previously broken!)

**Details:**
- Button text changed from "Follow" to "Following"
- Follower count updated from 0 to 1
- **NO "Already following" error** (critical fix confirmed!)
- New database record created (different ID from first follow)
- No errors in console

**Database Verification:**
```yaml
Document: userFollows/IrAEgdFCRHV3U4JmP1Xl (NEW document ID!)
followerId: TozfQg0dAHe4ToLyiSnkDqe3ECj2 (John)
followingId: OISHCcKZvUYdt9HTxLuvZLh3YDx2 (T-Lok)
createdAt: 2025-10-30T03:46:45.900Z (NEW timestamp!)
```

### Test 4: Real-Time Count Calculation

**Action**: Refresh profile page after follow/unfollow operations  
**Expected**: Follower count always matches actual database state  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **PASS**

**Details:**
- Follower count calculated fresh on every page load
- Count always matches `userFollows` collection query results
- No stale data issues
- No caching issues

## üîß Issues Found and Fixed During Testing

### Issue 1: Missing `deleteDoc` Import
**Error**: `ReferenceError: deleteDoc is not defined`  
**Fix**: Added `deleteDoc` to imports in `leaderboards.ts`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### Issue 2: Undefined `followingUserAvatar` Value
**Error**: `Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field followingUserAvatar)`  
**Fix**: Changed `followingUserData?.avatar || followingUserData?.profilePicture` to include `|| ''` fallback  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### Issue 3: Permission Error for `socialStats` Document Creation
**Error**: `Missing or insufficient permissions` when trying to create `socialStats` for other users  
**Fix**: Modified `getUserSocialStats` to return calculated stats without persisting for non-own profiles  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### Issue 4: Missing Follow Status Check on Component Mount
**Error**: Button always shows "Follow" even when already following  
**Fix**: Added `checkIsFollowing()` function and `useEffect` to check follow status on mount  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

---

## üîí Security Verification

### Attack Vector 1: Follower Count Forgery
**Test**: Attempt to manually update `socialStats` for another user  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **BLOCKED** by Firestore rules  
**Verification**: Firestore rules prevent cross-user `socialStats` updates

### Attack Vector 2: Re-Follow Bug (Soft Delete)
**Test**: Follow ‚Üí Unfollow ‚Üí Re-Follow cycle  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** with hard delete  
**Verification**: Hard delete prevents stale data, re-follow works perfectly

### Attack Vector 3: Stale Follower Counts
**Test**: Check if follower counts can become out of sync  
**Result**: ‚úÖ **IMPOSSIBLE** with real-time calculation  
**Verification**: Counts are calculated from `userFollows` collection on every page load

---

## üìä Performance Verification

### Firestore Read Cost Per Profile View
- 1 read for `calculateFollowerCount()` query
- 1 read for `calculateFollowingCount()` query
- 1 read for `socialStats` document (if exists)
- **Total: 2-3 reads per profile view**

### Spark Plan Impact
- **Limit**: 50,000 reads/day (free)
- **Capacity**: ~16,666 profile views/day
- **Current Usage**: Minimal (test environment)
- **Recommendation**: ‚úÖ Sufficient for small-medium apps

### Console Metrics
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: 1,564ms (Good)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: 0.27 (Needs Improvement - unrelated to follow feature)
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: 1ms (Excellent)
