# Security Fix: Follower Count Forgery Prevention

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Severity:** üî¥ **P1 - Critical**  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

---

## üö® Security Vulnerability

### Problem
The previous implementation allowed ANY authenticated user to forge follower counts for ANY account by directly updating the `socialStats` collection from client-side code.

### Root Cause
Firestore security rules for `socialStats` collection had an overly permissive update rule:

```javascript
// ‚ùå INSECURE (Previous)
allow update: if isAuthenticated() && (
  userId == request.auth.uid ||
  isAdmin() ||
  // This clause allowed ANYONE to update ANYONE's follower counts!
  (request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['followersCount', 'followingCount', 'lastUpdated']))
);
```

**Attack Vector:**
1. Attacker could call `updateDoc()` on any user's `socialStats` document
2. As long as they only modified `followersCount`, `followingCount`, or `lastUpdated`, the operation would succeed
3. This could be used to artificially inflate follower counts for leaderboard manipulation

---

## ‚úÖ Security Fix

### Updated Security Rules

```javascript
// ‚úÖ SECURE (Current)
allow update: if isAuthenticated() && (
  userId == request.auth.uid ||  // Only update your own stats
  isAdmin()                       // Or be an admin
);
// No longer allows arbitrary follower count updates
```

### Code Changes

**File:** `firestore.rules` (lines 628-642)
- Removed the permissive clause that allowed updating other users' follower counts
- Added security comments explaining the restriction

**File:** `src/services/leaderboards.ts`
- Removed client-side updates to other users' `followersCount` (lines 465, 520)
- Removed calls to `recomputeUserReputation` for other users (was calling for both users, now only current user)
- Updated `recomputeUserReputation` to use `calculateFollowerCount()` instead of reading from socialStats
- Added helper functions: `calculateFollowerCount()` and `calculateFollowingCount()`
- Added TODO comments for Cloud Functions migration
- Maintained updates to user's own `followingCount` (secure)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Implementation

### What Works Now
‚úÖ Users can follow/unfollow other users  
‚úÖ User's own `followingCount` is updated securely  
‚úÖ Hard delete prevents re-follow bugs  
‚úÖ Security rules prevent forgery  

### What's Changed
‚ö†Ô∏è `followersCount` in `socialStats` is NO LONGER updated client-side  
‚ö†Ô∏è Follower counts should be calculated on-the-fly or via Cloud Functions  

### Helper Functions (Secure Alternative)

Two new functions calculate follower/following counts from the `userFollows` collection:

```typescript
// Calculate from userFollows collection (secure)
const followerCount = await calculateFollowerCount(userId);
const followingCount = await calculateFollowingCount(userId);
```

These functions:
- Query the `userFollows` collection directly
- Cannot be forged (read-only queries)
- Return accurate real-time counts
- Are slightly slower than reading from `socialStats`

---

## üìã Final Solution

### Production Implementation (Current)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented & Deployed

- **On-demand calculation** from `userFollows` collection
- Use `calculateFollowerCount()` and `calculateFollowingCount()` helper functions
- `getUserSocialStats()` always returns accurate counts from source of truth
- Performance impact: Minor (additional Firestore query per user displayed)
- Security: Fully secure - counts cannot be forged
- **Stays on Firebase Spark (free) plan** - no Cloud Functions needed

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Always accurate** - self-healing, no sync issues
- ‚úÖ **Cannot be forged** - computed from authenticated writes to `userFollows`
- ‚úÖ **Free tier compatible** - no Blaze plan required
- ‚úÖ **Simpler architecture** - less code to maintain
- ‚úÖ **Defense in depth** - even if rules are bypassed, counts are recalculated

**Implementation Details:**
- `getUserSocialStats()` calls `calculateFollowerCount()` and `calculateFollowingCount()` every time (lines 615-618 in leaderboards.ts)
- Returns calculated counts, overriding any stored values (lines 644-647 in leaderboards.ts)
- SocialFeatures component refreshes after follow/unfollow for immediate UI updates

### Alternative Approach (Not Implemented)
**Cloud Functions with Cached Counts**

We considered using Cloud Functions to maintain cached follower counts:

```javascript
// NOT IMPLEMENTED - Requires Blaze plan
exports.updateFollowerCount = functions.firestore
  .document('userFollows/{followId}')
  .onWrite(async (change, context) => {
    // Update followersCount for the followed user
    // Admin SDK bypasses security rules
  });
```

**Why we didn't implement this:**
- ‚ùå Requires Firebase Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan
- ‚ùå More complex (introduces Cloud Functions dependency)
- ‚ùå Additional failure points (trigger might fail)
- ‚ùå Doesn't add significant value for our scale
- ‚úÖ On-demand calculation is fast enough and more reliable

### Future Optimization (If Needed)
**Status:** üí≠ Only if scale demands it

If follower queries become a performance bottleneck:
- Add client-side caching (cache counts for 5 minutes in UI)
- Use `socialStats` as a cache, refresh periodically with on-demand calculation
- Implement pagination for users with thousands of followers
- Consider Redis cache for high-traffic pages

**Current scale:** On-demand calculation is acceptable and preferred for simplicity and reliability.

## üß™ Testing

### Security Validation

**Test:** Attempt to forge follower count
```typescript
// This should FAIL with security rules
await updateDoc(doc(db, 'socialStats', 'someOtherUser'), {
  followersCount: 1000000
});
// ‚ùå Error: Missing or insufficient permissions
```

**Test:** Calculate follower count (secure alternative)
```typescript
const count = await calculateFollowerCount('someUser');
// ‚úÖ Returns accurate count from userFollows collection
```

### Functional Testing
- ‚úÖ Follow user works
- ‚úÖ Unfollow user works  
- ‚úÖ Re-follow after unfollow works
- ‚úÖ Follower counts accurate (when calculated)
- ‚úÖ Cannot forge follower counts

## üìä Performance Impact

| Operation | Before | After | Impact |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Follow User | 1 write | 1 write | No change |
| Unfollow User | 1 write | 1 write | No change |
| Display Follower Count | 1 read (cached) | 1 query (count) | Slightly slower |
| Security | ‚ùå Forgeable | ‚úÖ Secure | **Critical improvement** |

### Performance Notes
- Follower count calculation requires a Firestore query instead of a simple document read
- For most use cases, this is acceptable and preferred for security and reliability
- Query cost scales with follower count, but Firebase free tier is generous (50K reads/day)
- If needed, client-side caching can reduce query frequency

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Never trust client-side updates** for user-owned data that affects other users
2. **Security rules must enforce ownership** - don't rely on field-level restrictions alone
3. **Calculated counts are more secure** than cached counts - the slight performance cost is worth it for data integrity
4. **On-demand calculation** from source of truth eliminates sync issues and stays on free tier
5. **Cloud Functions add complexity** - only use when absolutely necessary for scale
6. **Always review security rules** for privilege escalation vulnerabilities
