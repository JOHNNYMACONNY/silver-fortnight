| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our application seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue**

2. Email us at  with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Possible impacts of the vulnerability
   - Any potential mitigations you've identified

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 96 hours, including:

- Whether the vulnerability is accepted or declined
- Our planned timeline for addressing the issue
- Any potential mitigations you can apply in the meantime

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Token validation and rotation

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Secure communication over HTTPS only
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### Development Practices

- Security-focused code review process
- Regular dependency audits
- Automated security testing
- Static code analysis
- Continuous security monitoring

## Security Requirements

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Generate secure values for all security-related environment variables
3. Never commit `.env` files to version control

### Development Requirements

1. Enable 2FA for your GitHub account
2. Use strong passwords for all development accounts
3. Keep your local development environment secure and updated
4. Follow the secure coding guidelines in our documentation

### Pre-commit Checks

All commits must pass:

- Security linting rules
- TypeScript strict mode checks
- Dependency vulnerability scans
- Unit tests including security tests

### CI Security Checks

Our CI runs `scripts/security-checks.sh`, which performs:
- npm audit (warn on low-severity issues, fail on high)
- ESLint security rules (treated as warnings in CI to avoid blocking deploys; details reported)
- Sensitive files detection
  - Fails only if sensitive files are tracked in git
  - Untracked local files like `.env` are warnings
- Security tests via `jest.config.security.cjs`

### Code Review Requirements

Security-related changes require:

1. Two approving reviews from security team members
2. Passing CI/CD security checks
3. Documentation updates if applicable
4. Security test coverage

### Environment Files

- Example env: `.env.example` must exist and be kept up-to-date
- Local env: `.env` must never be committed; CI treats presence as a warning only if untracked

## Security Best Practices

### Password Policy

- Minimum 12 characters
- Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- No common patterns or dictionary words
- Password strength meter implementation
- Regular password rotation enforced
- Secure password reset flow

### API Security

- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Request size limitations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without info disclosure
- Security headers implementation
- API versioning

### Data Handling

1. Minimize data collection
2. Encrypt sensitive data
3. Regular data cleanup
4. Secure data transmission
5. Access logging and monitoring

## Incident Response

### Response Process

1. Immediate triage and severity assessment
2. Containment measures implementation
3. Root cause analysis
4. Remediation plan development
5. Post-incident review and documentation

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate response required (< 2 hours)
- **High**: Same-day response required (< 8 hours)
- **Medium**: Response within 48 hours
- **Low**: Response within 1 week

## Compliance

### Requirements

- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- HIPAA compliance where applicable
- Regular security audits
- Documentation of all security measures

### Regular Reviews

- Monthly dependency audits
- Quarterly security assessments
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous compliance monitoring
