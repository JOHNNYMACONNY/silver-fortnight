## ‚úÖ TEST 1: COLLABORATION CREATION WORKFLOW - **PASSED**

### Background
**Bug Fixed:** `CreateCollaborationPage.tsx` was using `CollaborationForm_legacy` component which did not collect required fields (`roles`, `skillsRequired`, `maxParticipants`), causing Firebase "invalid data" errors.

**Fix Applied:** Replaced legacy form with modern `CollaborationForm` component that properly collects all required fields including roles with skills.

### Test Steps
1. ‚úÖ Navigated to Collaborations page
2. ‚úÖ Clicked "Create New Collaboration"
3. ‚úÖ Filled collaboration title: "Browser Test Collaboration"
4. ‚úÖ Filled description: "Testing the fixed collaboration creation workflow with proper roles and validation."
5. ‚úÖ Clicked "Add Role" - Role dialog opened successfully
6. ‚úÖ Filled role details:
   - Role Title: "Frontend Developer"
   - Role Description: "Build UI components and implement designs"
   - Required Skills: Added "React" (Intermediate level)
7. ‚úÖ Clicked "Add role" - Role added to collaboration
8. ‚úÖ Clicked "Create Collaboration" - Button changed to "Saving..."
9. ‚úÖ Successfully redirected to collaboration detail page

### Results
**Status:** ‚úÖ **PASSED - Collaboration created successfully!**

## üîÑ TEST 2: COLLABORATION APPLICATION WORKFLOW - **REQUIRES MANUAL TESTING**

### Background
**Bug Fixed:** `CollaborationApplicationForm.tsx` was passing `userProfile.photoURL` directly, which could be `undefined` for users without profile pictures. This caused Firebase "Unsupported field value: undefined" errors.

**Fixes Applied:**
1. `CollaborationApplicationForm.tsx` - Changed `applicantPhotoURL: userProfile.photoURL || null`
2. `collaborationApplicationConverter` - Added global filter to remove undefined values
3. `CollaborationApplication` interface - Updated to accept `string | null`
4. Preventive fixes applied to `TradeProposalForm`, `ChatInput`, and legacy form

### Test Requirements
To test this workflow, we need:
1. Secondary account (LJKEONI) logged in
2. Navigate to collaboration: `http://localhost:5175/collaborations/Arwqzn6VOzSg5m0IzChR`
3. Click "Apply" or "Manage role" for the "Frontend Developer" role
4. Fill out application form
5. Submit and verify:
   - ‚úÖ No "undefined photoURL" console errors
   - ‚úÖ Application submitted successfully
   - ‚úÖ Application appears in primary account's pending applications

### Status
**‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSED** - Google Sign-in not available on localhost. Requires user to manually log in as LJKEONI.

### User Instructions for Manual Testing
1. Open localhost:5175 in your browser
2. Log in as LJKEONI (use live site for Google Sign-in if needed, or email/password if available)
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5175/collaborations/Arwqzn6VOzSg5m0IzChR`
4. Apply for the "Frontend Developer" role
5. Check browser console for any errors
6. Report back results
