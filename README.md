## Recent Achievements
### Challenges System Updates (August 2025)

What changed
- Standardized cards: `ChallengesPage` now uses shared `ChallengeCard` with footer CTAs (View/Join)
- Tabs added: All / Active / My Challenges
- Recommendations MVP: “Recommended for you” section powered by `getRecommendedChallenges`
  - Now enriched using user’s recent categories and a difficulty band around their average
  - Now excludes already-joined challenges in the returned results
- UI hardening: Safe rendering for missing `difficulty` and `rewards.xp`
- Detail page alignment: Uses `services/challenges.getChallenge` and shared types; normalizes `status`/`difficulty`
- Dashboard: Mounted `ThreeTierProgressionUI`
- Progression → Filters: `ThreeTierProgressionUI` tier clicks now navigate to `ChallengesPage?type=solo|trade|collaboration`; `ChallengesPage` applies the filter from the query param
  - Added per‑tab empty‑states and a Clear filters control
  - Challenge detail page now supports real joining and shows user progress with an “Ending soon” badge

One-time maintenance
- Normalize existing challenge docs:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/backfill-challenges.ts
```
- Verify indexes (e.g., status==ACTIVE + orderBy(endDate)) and deploy if needed:
```bash
npm run firebase:indexes:verify
npm run deploy:indexes
```

Verify UI behavior
```bash
# Run targeted tests
npx jest src/__tests__/ChallengesPageRender.test.tsx src/__tests__/ChallengesPageTabs.test.tsx src/__tests__/ChallengesPageEmptyAndClearFilters.test.tsx
```

Analytics (Challenges)
- `challenge_recommendation_impressions`: count of recommended items shown
- `challenge_joins`: total joins
- `challenge_recommendation_joins`: joins originating from recommendations
- `challenge_filters_zero_results`: filters produced zero results
- `challenge_filters_cleared`: Clear filters action

Indexes
- Added composite index: `challenges (status ASC, endDate ASC)` for active challenges ordered by end date

Seeding & E2E
- Challenge seeding: `npx tsx scripts/seed-challenges.ts`
- E2E (requires Playwright setup): `npx playwright test e2e/challenges-recommendations.spec.ts`

For more detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Development Guidelines

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration, especially for Firebase. These are loaded through Vite's built-in environment variable support.

In the code, environment variables are accessed using:

```typescript
import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template before starting development.

### Production Operations

**Before making any production changes:**

1. Validate production environment:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:production:full
   ```

2. Check system health:
   ```bash
   npm run health:check:production
   ```

3. Monitor performance:
   ```bash
   npm run performance:monitor:production
   ```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices with functional components and hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- Document Firebase operations and index requirements
- Use production-ready patterns for database operations
