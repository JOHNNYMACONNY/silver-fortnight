## What We Learned

### Challenge System Architecture

1. **Solo Challenges** - Individual completion, unlocked by default
2. **Trade Challenges** - Require 3 Solo completions + skill level 2
3. **Collaboration Challenges** - Require 5 Trade completions + skill level 3
4. **Tier Locking** - Prevents users from joining challenges above their tier

### Reward Calculation

**Base XP by Difficulty:**
- Beginner: 100 XP
- Intermediate: 200 XP
- Advanced: 350 XP
- Expert: 500 XP

**Possible Bonuses:**
- Quality: up to +50% (based on quality score)
- Early completion: +25% (if < 75% of estimated time)
- First attempt: +15% (first try success)
- Streak bonus: Variable (based on challenge streaks)

### Multi-User Limitations Found

**Browser Testing Limitation:**
- Same browser session shares authentication
- Cannot have 2 different users logged in simultaneously in same browser
- Need either:
  - Different browsers (Chrome tab 1 vs Firefox tab 2)
  - Incognito mode
  - Manual logout/login between users

**Recommendation:** Multi-user collaboration testing can be done separately or with manual user coordination.
