# Performance Optimization Implementation

This document tracks the implementation progress of the performance optimization plan outlined in `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`.

## Performance Measurement Tools

We've created several utilities to help measure and analyze performance:

- [x] `performanceMetrics.ts`: Utility for measuring and logging performance metrics
- [x] `PerformanceMonitor.tsx`: Component for collecting performance metrics on pages
- [x] `bundleAnalyzer.ts`: Utility for analyzing bundle sizes
- [x] `renderProfiler.tsx`: Utility for identifying components with unnecessary re-renders

## Baseline Performance Metrics

Before implementing any optimizations, we need to establish baseline performance metrics to measure improvements against.

### Key Pages to Measure

- [ ] Home page
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Trade listings
- [ ] Trade details
- [ ] Profile page
- [ ] Messaging
- [ ] Collaborations

### Metrics to Collect

- [ ] Load Time
- [ ] Time to Interactive
- [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- [ ] First Input Delay (FID)
- [ ] Bundle Size
- [ ] Component render times

## Performance Bottlenecks

After collecting baseline metrics, we'll identify performance bottlenecks:

- [ ] Components with unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Missing dependency arrays in hooks
- [ ] Large dependencies in bundle
- [ ] Unoptimized images and assets
- [ ] Inefficient context usage
- [ ] Render-blocking resources
