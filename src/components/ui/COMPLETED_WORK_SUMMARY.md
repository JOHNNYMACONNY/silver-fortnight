- **Tree Shaking**: Configured proper tree shaking for UI libraries and dependencies.
- **Dependency Optimization**: Restructured imports for better tree shaking and smaller bundles.

### Component Optimization ✅

- **Memoization**: Applied React.memo to pure components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Hook Dependencies**: Optimized useEffect and useCallback dependency arrays.
- **Context Optimization**: Improved context usage to minimize re-renders.
- **Event Handler Optimization**: Used useCallback for event handlers to maintain referential equality.

### Rendering Optimization ✅

- **Virtualization**: Implemented virtualization for long lists and grids using react-window.
- **Infinite Loading**: Added infinite loading support with react-window-infinite-loader.
- **Animation Performance**: Optimized animations to reduce layout thrashing and improve performance.
- **Layout Shift Reduction**: Minimized cumulative layout shift during page load.

### Asset Optimization ✅

- **Image Optimization**: Created LazyImage component with responsive images and WebP support.
- **Lazy Loading**: Added loading="lazy" and decoding="async" attributes to images.
- **Responsive Images**: Implemented srcSet and sizes attributes for optimal image loading.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Optimized Cloudinary usage with proper quality and format parameters.

### Resource Loading ✅

- **Preloading**: Implemented preloading for critical resources.
- **Prefetching**: Added prefetching for likely-to-be-needed resources.
- **Preconnecting**: Established early connections to external domains.
- **Route-Based Preloading**: Implemented route-specific resource preloading.

## Responsive Design

### Responsive Testing ✅

- **Screen Size Testing**: Tested all components across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Verified compatibility with Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
- **Device Testing**: Ensured proper functionality on various devices and orientations.
- **Touch Optimization**: Verified touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile interaction.

### Mobile Optimization ✅

- **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed components with mobile-first principles.
- **Touch-Friendly UI**: Ensured all interactive elements are easy to tap on mobile.
- **Responsive Typography**: Implemented responsive font sizes for better readability.
- **Fluid Layouts**: Used percentage-based widths and flexible grids for fluid layouts.
- **Content Containment**: Implemented proper content truncation and scrollable containers for cards with varying content lengths.

## Bug Fixes

- **Console Errors**: Fixed React warnings related to DOM properties (e.g., fetchPriority → fetchpriority).
- **Type Definitions**: Added proper TypeScript declarations for third-party libraries.
- **Layout Issues**: Resolved layout issues on various screen sizes.
- **Animation Glitches**: Fixed animation glitches and performance issues.
- **Content Overflow**: Fixed trade card content overflow issues with proper truncation and scrollable containers.
- **Profile Image Errors**: Improved error handling for missing profile images to reduce console errors.
- **HTML Attribute Casing**: Fixed HTML attribute casing in LazyImage component to comply with React standards.
- **Card Layout**: Enhanced trade cards with flex layout and proper content distribution for better visual consistency.

## Documentation
