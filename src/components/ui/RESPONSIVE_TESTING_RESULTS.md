## Conclusion

All components in the TradeYa design system have been tested across different screen sizes and found to be responsive and accessible. The components adapt well to different viewport sizes, maintaining usability and visual consistency across devices.

The responsive design approach using Tailwind's utility classes has proven effective, with components naturally adapting to different screen sizes through the use of responsive modifiers.

## Recommendations

While all components passed the responsive testing, here are some recommendations for future improvements:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Continue to monitor performance on mobile devices, especially for animation-heavy components
2. **Touch Optimization**: Consider further optimizing touch interactions for complex components
3. **Responsive Images**: Implement responsive image loading for better performance on mobile
4. **Reduced Motion**: Add support for users who prefer reduced motion
