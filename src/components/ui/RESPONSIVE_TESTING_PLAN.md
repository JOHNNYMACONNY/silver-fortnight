## Responsive Design Principles to Follow

1. **Mobile-first approach**: Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
2. **Fluid layouts**: Use percentage-based widths and flexible grids
3. **Responsive typography**: Use relative units (rem, em) for font sizes
4. **Breakpoints**: Use consistent breakpoints across the application
5. **Touch-friendly**: Ensure interactive elements are easy to tap on mobile
6. **Progressive enhancement**: Provide core functionality for all devices, enhance for larger screens

## Completed Steps ✅

1. ✅ Prioritize and fix identified issues
2. ✅ Implement responsive improvements
3. ✅ Re-test fixed components
4. ✅ Document responsive design patterns for future development

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring responsive behavior as new features are added
2. Conduct periodic responsive testing to ensure continued compatibility
3. Optimize for new device types and screen sizes as they become popular
4. Enhance responsive features based on user feedback and analytics
