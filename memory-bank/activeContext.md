## Current Focus

* **Firestore Migration Infrastructure**: The project is currently focused on production migration execution with comprehensive testing and monitoring systems in place
* **Performance Optimization**: Advanced performance monitoring with RUM service, smart preloading, and asset optimization completed
* **Production Readiness**: Migration validation, rollback procedures, and production deployment infrastructure are fully implemented

## Recent Changes

* **Migration Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage for production migration scenarios, rollback procedures, and data validation
* **Performance Monitoring**: Real User Monitoring (RUM) service implementation with critical path analysis and smart resource optimization
* **Production Infrastructure**: Complete production deployment configuration with phased migration execution and monitoring systems
* **Security Enhancements**: Advanced security monitoring, role-based access control, and comprehensive security testing

## Open Questions/Issues

* **Migration Execution Timeline**: Final production migration execution scheduling and stakeholder coordination
* **Performance Baseline**: Establishing production performance baselines for post-migration comparison
* **User Communication**: Final user notification strategy for migration activities

[2025-06-17 13:25:19] - **Current Focus**: Fresh Layout Implementation Plan - Strategic decision made to rebuild styling with clean Tailwind v4 approach rather than continue incremental fixes. Starting with Phase 1: Foundation (src/index.css) as lowest-risk, highest-impact first step.

* **Monitoring Alerts**: Fine-tuning production monitoring alert thresholds and escalation procedures

## Latest Changes

* [2025-09-07 05:04:51] - Fixed Vercel build error by implementing conditional husky installation in prepare script, resolving deployment compatibility while maintaining local development functionality.

[2025-09-07 06:38:49] - **Current Focus**: Addressing 2165 ESLint issues (2067 errors, 98 warnings) causing Vercel build failures. Systematic approach to fix critical errors, high-impact issues, and warnings to enable successful deployment.

[2025-09-07 06:42:36] - ESLint analysis completed with corrected configuration, revealing 2687 total problems. Now prioritizing critical build-blocking errors.
