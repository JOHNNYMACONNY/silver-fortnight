# Notification Display Bug Fix - Quick Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## The Bug

Notifications showed only timestamps, no content:
```
[icon] [blank space] 2 hours ago [delete]
```

## Root Cause

4 components displaying wrong field:
- Looking for `notification.message` (optional, undefined)
- Should use `notification.content` (required, always present)

## The Fix

Updated 4 components:
1. **NotificationsPage.tsx** - Now displays title + content + time
2. **NotificationDropdown.tsx** - Fixed field check and display
3. **NotificationBell.tsx** - Corrected field priority order
4. **NotificationItem.tsx** - Corrected field priority order

## Result

Notifications now display properly:
```
[icon] Trade Completed
       Your trade has been completed!
       2 hours ago [delete]
```

## Testing

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Backward compatible with old notifications
- ✅ Documentation updated
