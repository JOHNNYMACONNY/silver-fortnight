## TradeYa Development Context

I'm continuing work on the **TradeYa skill trading platform**. Here's the current status and what we should focus on next:

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (May 28, 2025)

**Jest/Vitest Configuration Resolution** - Successfully resolved test execution conflicts:

- Converted `TradeConfirmationForm.test.tsx` from Vitest to Jest syntax
- Enhanced `jest.config.ts` with proper module mapping and TypeScript support
- Removed conflicting `vitest.config.ts` configuration
- Validated firebase-config mocking for Jest environment
- **Result**: All TradeConfirmationForm tests now pass, Jest test execution works reliably

**Documentation Updated**:

- Created `docs/JEST_CONFIGURATION_RESOLUTION.md` with technical details
- Updated `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`
- Established Jest testing best practices for the project

### üéØ Suggested Next Actions (Pick One)

**Option 1: Test Suite Expansion** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

- Identify and convert other test files that may have Vitest syntax conflicts
- Expand test coverage for TradeConfirmationForm component with edge cases
- Create tests for related trade lifecycle components that are currently untested
- Run full test suite analysis to identify gaps

## Option 2: TradeConfirmationForm Enhancement**

- Review the component for potential improvements based on current implementation
- Add loading states, better error handling, or UI enhancements
- Implement accessibility improvements
- Add input validation and user feedback

## Option 3: Component Development**

- Continue building out the trade lifecycle system components
- Work on collaboration roles system components that need implementation
- Develop portfolio system components
- Address any TypeScript compilation issues in other components

## Option 4: Technical Debt Resolution**

- Address the firebase-security.test.ts failure (missing `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`)
- Fix React `act()` warnings in role management tests
- Resolve other failing tests identified in the recent test run
- Clean up any remaining configuration issues

### üìÇ Key Files & Context

**Project Structure**:

- **Main workspace**: `/Users/johnroberts/Documents/TradeYa Exp`
- **Test runner**: Jest (configuration at `jest.config.ts`)
- **Recently fixed test**: `src/components/features/trades/__tests__/TradeConfirmationForm.test.tsx`
- **Firebase mock**: `src/utils/__mocks__/firebase-config.ts` (working correctly)

**Current Test Status**:

- ‚úÖ TradeConfirmationForm: All tests passing
- ‚ùå Some collaboration role tests: Need React `act()` fixes
- ‚ùå Firebase security tests: Missing dependencies
- ‚úÖ Most utility and basic component tests: Passing

**Documentation**:

- **Primary progress tracking**: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`
- **Testing guide**: `docs/TESTING.md`
- **Recent technical details**: `docs/JEST_CONFIGURATION_RESOLUTION.md`

### üîß Technical Context

**Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library  
**Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)  
**UI**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system  

**Recent Fixes Applied**:

- Jest configuration enhanced with globals and module mapping
- TypeScript support improved in test environment
- Firebase mocking properly configured for `import.meta` syntax
- Test file syntax standardized to Jest patterns

### üí° Development Guidelines

1. **Testing First**: Always validate changes with Jest tests
2. **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing throughout
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when making changes
4. **Firebase Mocking**: Use existing mock patterns in `src/utils/__mocks__/`
5. **Component Structure**: Follow established patterns in trade lifecycle components

## Action Request

Please analyze the current state and suggest which option above makes the most sense, or propose an alternative direction. Then help me implement the chosen path with proper testing and documentation updates.

**Preferred Focus**: I'm particularly interested in **Option 1 (Test Suite Expansion)** to ensure we have a solid testing foundation before building more features, but I'm open to your recommendations based on the current codebase state.
