2. Build challenge system UI components
3. Implement simplified collaboration interface
4. Develop AI recommendation engine
5. Add advanced UI features

8. Expand tests for edge cases (invalid role state transitions, missing docs)

## üìù NOTES

- This document reflects the actual state of the codebase after fixes
- Many features documented as "complete" are actually placeholders
- The core infrastructure is solid and production-ready
- Focus should be on completing user-facing features
- Real-time functionality needs improvement for better user experience
 - Brand/design-system alignment completed: semantic tokens in place, glassmorphic pages standardized, Button `asChild` rule enforced.

## üß≠ DEVELOPER RECOMMENDATIONS (For Future Development)

### Firestore & Data-Shaping
- Use `getSyncFirebaseDb()`/`getSyncFirebaseAuth()` exclusively (avoid `db()`/direct singletons).
- Avoid spreading unknown Firestore data (no `...doc.data()`). Prefer `Object.assign({ id: doc.id }, doc.data() as Record<string, unknown>)`.
- Keep converter/generics aligned: `FirestoreDataConverter<AppModelType, DocumentData, DocumentData>`.
- Store timestamps as `Timestamp` and only convert at the UI layer.

### Type Safety
- Continue removing `any` casts; enrich domain interfaces (e.g., `CollaborationRoleData` completion fields).
- Prefer string-literal enums for states (`RoleState`, `CompletionRequestStatus`, `ChallengeType`).
- Validate external indices/keys with type guards before indexing objects.

### Services & Errors
- Route all data access through services; avoid direct Firestore calls in components.
- Use `AppError` with `ErrorCode` and `ErrorSeverity` consistently; keep `ErrorContext` minimal and typed.

### Testing
- Centralize environment mocks in Jest setup: `matchMedia`, `ResizeObserver`, `IntersectionObserver`.
- Mock Firestore `runTransaction` (already added) for transactional service tests.
- Cover happy and guard paths: tier gating (block/success), permission checks (creator-only), missing-doc cases.

### Configuration
- Tier-gating controlled via `VITE_ENFORCE_TIER_GATING` (accepts `1/true/yes`); keep gating checks defensive but non-blocking when disabled.

### UI/Design System
- Tailwind CSS v4 syntax only; keep animations mindful of `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- When using `Button asChild`, ensure a single child element and include icons/text within it.
- Keep brand/glass audits in validation (`npm run lint:brand`, `npm run lint:glass`).

### Portfolio
- Use portfolio services for CRUD and visibility/pin/feature toggles.
- Generate portfolio items on completion flows via `generateTradePortfolioItem` / `generateCollaborationPortfolioItem`.

## üîé DESIGN-SYSTEM AUDITS (Current)

- Brand token audit: `npm run lint:brand` ‚Äî PASS
- Glassmorphism audit: `npm run lint:glass` ‚Äî PASS
- Enforcement: both included in `npm run validate`

## üîÑ RECENT FIXES (December 2024)

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **Database Reference Error**: Fixed 15 instances of `db()` ‚Üí `getSyncFirebaseDb()` in challenges.ts
2. **Missing Indexes**: Added 3 leaderboardStats indexes for proper querying
3. **Migration Registry**: Changed warning to info log for duplicate initialization

### Verification Steps:
- [ ] Start development server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test challenges page functionality
- [ ] Verify no "db is not defined" errors
- [ ] Check leaderboard functionality (after index deployment)
- [ ] Confirm reduced migration warnings

### Deployment Required:
```bash
# Deploy the new indexes (trades + collaborations skillsIndex)
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes --project tradeya-45ede
```

### Backfill Utilities (Skills Index)
```bash
# Collaborations (dry run)
npx tsx scripts/backfill-collab-skills-index.ts --project=tradeya-45ede --dry

# Collaborations (execute)
npx tsx scripts/backfill-collab-skills-index.ts --project=tradeya-45ede
```

## üîÑ RECENT FIXES (August 2025)

### UI Hardening: Challenges Page
1. Prevented runtime crash when `challenge.difficulty` is missing from Firestore by defaulting to `beginner` in `src/pages/ChallengesPage.tsx`.
2. Impact: Eliminates `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')` and allows the Challenges list to render even with incomplete data.
3. Follow-ups: Consider validating challenge documents to always include `difficulty` and backfilling existing records.

### Accessibility and Interaction Hardening
1. Button default type set to `button` by default with `aria-busy` support in `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`.
2. Button `asChild` now renders a single child to satisfy Radix `Slot` requirements, fixing `React.Children.only` errors in dropdown triggers. If icons are needed, include them inside the single child element.
2. ConnectionCard action buttons updated to stop propagation to avoid unintended card navigation.
3. Evidence previews made fully keyboard-accessible with role, tabIndex, and Enter/Space handlers; images use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`.
4. Open tasks: Add modal focus trap and restore-to-trigger focus; standardize lazy/decoding across images; audit reduced-motion gating for custom animations.

### Services Hardening & Tests
1. Tier-gating logic made enum-safe in `src/services/challenges.ts`; added tests for block/success.
2. Role completion flows aligned with types and Firestore shape; tests added for approve/reject and creator-only permission.
3. Role abandonment/reopen flows validated with tests; ensured notification side-effects are non-blocking.
4. Jest setup enhanced with `runTransaction` mock to support transactional services in tests.

### UI Consistency Updates (Notifications Dropdown)
1. Notification dropdown now uses the same glassmorphic surface as `UserMenu` (`bg-navbar-glass dark:bg-navbar-glass-dark backdrop-blur-md navbar-gradient-border shadow-glass-lg`).
2. Improved readability with a grid layout, clearer hierarchy (title/body/time), dividers, and better spacing.
3. Fixed bug where clicking a single notification called the bulk API; now calls `markNotificationAsRead(id)` correctly. Bulk "Mark all" remains available.
4. Documentation added: `docs/NOTIFICATIONS_DROPDOWN_AUDIT.md`.
