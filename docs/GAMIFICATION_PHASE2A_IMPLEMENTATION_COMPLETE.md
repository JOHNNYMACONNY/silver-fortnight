## Critical Integration Points

### ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY

These integration points are critical for Phase 2A functionality:

1. **Gamification Service Callback System**
   ```typescript
   // In src/services/gamification.ts
   let notificationCallback: ((notification: any) => void) | null = null;
   export const setGamificationNotificationCallback = (callback: (notification: any) => void) => {
     notificationCallback = callback;
   };
   ```

2. **App.tsx Provider Chain**
   ```tsx
   <GamificationNotificationProvider>
     <NotificationContainer />
     <GamificationIntegration />
   </GamificationNotificationProvider>
   ```

3. **XP Award Integration Points**
   - `awardTradeCompletionXP()` calls
   - `awardRoleCompletionXP()` calls
   - `awardEvidenceSubmissionXP()` calls

### ⚠️ Breaking Change Prevention

- Never remove the notification callback system
- Maintain backward compatibility for notification types
- Preserve user preference localStorage keys
- Keep existing gamification service API unchanged

## Conclusion

Phase 2A successfully transforms the TradeYa gamification system from a static progress tracker into an engaging, interactive experience. The implementation provides immediate visual feedback, celebrates user achievements, and maintains excellent performance while respecting accessibility requirements.

The system is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for future gamification enhancements in Phase 2B and beyond.
