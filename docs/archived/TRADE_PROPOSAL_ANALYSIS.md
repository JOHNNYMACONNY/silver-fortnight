# Trade Proposal System Analysis

## Overview

Based on my comprehensive review of the TradeYa codebase, I've analyzed the trade proposal system and how it works for trade creators. Here's my detailed assessment of the proposal section's look, functionality, and user experience.

## System Architecture

### Trade Data Structure
```typescript
interface Trade {
  id?: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  creatorId: string;
  creatorName?: string;
  creatorPhotoURL?: string;
  participantId?: string;
  participantName?: string;
  participantPhotoURL?: string;
  category: string;
  skillsOffered: TradeSkill[];
  skillsWanted: TradeSkill[];
  status: TradeStatus;
  interestedUsers?: string[];
  acceptedUserId?: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Trade Proposal Data Structure
```typescript
interface TradeProposal {
  id?: string;
  tradeId: string;
  proposerId: string;
  proposerName?: string;
  proposerPhotoURL?: string;
  message: string;
  skillsOffered: TradeSkill[];
  skillsRequested: TradeSkill[];
  evidence?: EmbeddedEvidence[];
  status: "pending" | "accepted" | "rejected";
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

## User Experience Analysis

### 1. **Proposal Display Location**
- **Location**: Proposals are displayed in a dedicated section at the bottom of the trade detail page
