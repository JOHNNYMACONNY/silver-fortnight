# TradeYa Implementation Progress

## Trade Lifecycle System

### Completed Features

1. **Trade Status Flow**
   - Implemented complete trade lifecycle with the following statuses:
     - `open`: Trade is open for proposals
     - `in_progress`: Trade is in progress after a proposal has been accepted
     - `pending_evidence`: One user has submitted evidence and is waiting for the other
     - `pending_confirmation`: Both users have submitted evidence, waiting for confirmation
     - `completed`: Trade has been confirmed as completed
     - `cancelled`: Trade has been cancelled

2. **Evidence System**
   - Implemented evidence submission for both trade creator and participant
   - Added support for multiple evidence types (images, links, text)
   - Created EvidenceGallery component for displaying evidence
   - Added validation to require at least one piece of evidence
   - Implemented backward compatibility for legacy evidence format

3. **Confirmation System**
   - Implemented trade confirmation workflow
   - Added TradeConfirmationForm component for reviewing and confirming trades
   - Added ability to request changes instead of confirming
   - Implemented change request history tracking

4. **User Interface**
   - Added clear status explanations for each trade status
   - Implemented dynamic action buttons based on trade status and user role
   - Added prominent confirmation button for trades in pending_confirmation status
   - Improved visual feedback for trade status changes

### In Progress Features

1. **Auto-Resolution System**
   - Need to implement Cloud Functions for scheduled tasks
   - Need to create reminder notifications for pending confirmations
   - Need to implement auto-completion functionality after timeout

2. **Gamification Integration**
   - Need to connect trade completion to XP system
   - Need to implement achievements related to trade completion

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the complete trade lifecycle flow
   - Verify all status transitions work correctly
   - Test with different user roles (creator, participant)
   - Test edge cases (timeouts, disputes, etc.)

2. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation to explain the trade lifecycle
   - Create admin documentation for managing trades

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries for trade status updates
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed trade data

## Technical Infrastructure

### Firebase

- Collections for users, trades, collaborations, conversations, challenges
- Field names can't start/end with underscores

### Cloudinary

- Used for image storage with cloud name "doqqhj2nt"
- Specific upload presets configured

### Performance Optimization

- 21.8% bundle size reduction
- Code splitting implemented
- Lazy loading implemented
- Virtualization using react-window components

## Known Issues

1. **Content Security Policy**
   - Issues preventing Google Fonts, Google Sign-In, and ui-avatars.com resources from loading

2. **Dark Mode**
   - Several components still need dark mode styling
   - Hover animations need improvement in dark mode

3. **Performance**
   - Excessive re-rendering in some components
   - ProfileImageWithUser component shows debug logs repeatedly in the console
