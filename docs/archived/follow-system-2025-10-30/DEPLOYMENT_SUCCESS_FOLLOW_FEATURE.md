## 🐛 Bugs Fixed in This Deployment

1. **Re-Follow Bug** (Critical - P0)
   - **Issue**: "Already following" error on re-follow
   - **Root Cause**: Soft delete left stale records
   - **Fix**: Implemented hard delete in `unfollowUser()`
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified

2. **Follower Count Forgery** (Critical - P1)
   - **Issue**: Users could manually update `socialStats.followersCount`
   - **Root Cause**: Permissive Firestore rules
   - **Fix**: Tightened security rules + real-time calculation
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified

3. **Missing Follow Status Check**
   - **Issue**: Follow button always showed "Follow" on page load
   - **Root Cause**: No database check on component mount
   - **Fix**: Added `checkIsFollowing()` function
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed and verified

4. **Missing Imports**
   - **Issue**: `deleteDoc` function not imported
   - **Fix**: Added to imports
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

   - **Issue**: Firestore rejected undefined `followingUserAvatar`
   - **Fix**: Added `|| ''` fallback
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed
