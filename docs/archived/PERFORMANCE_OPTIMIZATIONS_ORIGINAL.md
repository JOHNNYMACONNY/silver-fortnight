## Bundle Size Optimization

### Vite Configuration Enhancements

The Vite configuration has been updated to improve tree shaking and code splitting:

- Enhanced tree shaking configuration to eliminate unused code
- Implemented more granular chunk splitting for better caching
- Separated Firebase modules into individual chunks
- Optimized dependency pre-bundling

### Icon Import Optimization

The icon imports have been optimized to reduce bundle size:

- Centralized icon management in a single utility file
- Implemented named imports to ensure only used icons are included
- Configured Vite to properly tree-shake the icon library
- Avoided individual path imports due to TypeScript declaration issues

## Code Splitting

Implemented advanced code splitting strategies:

- Created separate chunks for major libraries (Firebase, Framer Motion, etc.)
- Implemented route-based code splitting
- Separated React and React Router into dedicated chunks
- Optimized vendor chunk splitting

## Image Loading Optimization

### Cloudinary Integration Improvements

Enhanced Cloudinary image loading for better performance:

- Implemented intelligent quality settings with `q_auto:good`
- Added automatic format detection with `f_auto` for WebP support
- Added automatic device pixel ratio handling with `dpr_auto`
- Optimized responsive image loading with proper srcSet and sizes

### LazyImage Component Enhancements

Optimized the LazyImage component for better performance:

- Implemented React.memo for better rendering performance
- Added useMemo for expensive calculations like srcSet generation
- Implemented useCallback for event handlers
- Added proper image dimensions to prevent layout shifts
- Reduced console logging in production builds

## Firebase Optimization

Optimized Firebase imports and usage:

- Implemented individual imports for Firebase modules
- Configured proper chunking for Firebase modules
- Reduced console logging in production builds

## Component Rendering Optimization

Enhanced component rendering performance:

- Implemented React.memo for pure components
- Added useMemo for expensive calculations
- Implemented useCallback for event handlers
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders

## Future Recommendations

For further performance improvements, consider:

1. **Server-Side Rendering or Static Generation**:
   - Consider migrating to Next.js for improved initial load performance

2. **Service Worker Implementation**:
   - Add offline capabilities and improved caching strategies

3. **Virtualization for Large Lists**:
   - Reconsider implementing virtualization for pages with large data sets

4. **Preloading Critical Resources**:
   - Implement preloading and prefetching for critical resources

5. **Content Security Policy Optimization**:
   - Consolidate CSP definitions to ensure consistency
   - Update CSP to allow necessary resources
   - Consider self-hosting critical resources where possible

6. **Firebase Query Optimization**:
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Add proper indexing for frequently used queries
   - Implement data caching for frequently accessed data

7. **Bundle Analysis and Further Optimization**:
   - Regularly analyze bundle size and identify opportunities for further optimization
   - Consider implementing dynamic imports for rarely used features
