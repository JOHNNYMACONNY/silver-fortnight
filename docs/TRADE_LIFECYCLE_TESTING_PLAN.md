# Trade Lifecycle Testing Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing plan for the Trade Lifecycle System to ensure all components work correctly and all status transitions function as expected.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify all trade status transitions work correctly
2. Ensure all UI components render appropriately based on trade status
3. Validate that user permissions are enforced correctly
4. Test edge cases and error handling
5. Verify integration with other systems (notifications, evidence)

### 6. Special Status Flows

#### 6.1 Cancel Trade
- **Action**: Cancel a trade

- **Expected Result**: All status transitions work correctly
- **Verification**: Trade status and history reflect all changes

#### 8.2 Concurrent Actions
- **Action**: Two users try to perform actions on the same trade simultaneously
- **Expected Result**: Database consistency is maintained
- **Verification**: Trade status is consistent

## Test Execution

### Test Procedure

1. Create test users and sample trades
2. Execute each test case in sequence
3. Document results and any issues found
4. Fix issues and retest

### Test Data

- Test User 1: Trade Creator
- Test User 2: Trade Participant
- Test User 3: Non-participant

## Expected Results

All test cases should pass with the expected results. Any failures should be documented and fixed before deployment.

## Conclusion

This testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to validating the Trade Lifecycle System. By executing these test cases, we can ensure that the system works correctly and provides a good user experience.
