- Other current executive summaries

## 📈 Impact Metrics

### Before Round 3
- Multiple completion summaries in active directories
- Historical verification reports mixed with active docs
- Typo duplicate file

### After Round 3
- **Deleted**: 4 outdated/redundant files
- **Archived**: 17 historical completion/verification documents
- **Organized**: Completion summaries and verification reports properly archived

### Archive Organization
- `docs/archived/completion-summaries/` - 15 historical completion documents
- `docs/archived/verification-reports/` - 2 historical verification reports

---

## 🎯 Rationale

### Why These Deletions?

1. **Outdated Summaries**: Historical workflow/documentation updates no longer relevant
2. **Historical Testing**: Old testing completion docs superseded by current testing guides
3. **Typo Files**: Duplicate/typo files that shouldn't exist

### Why These Moves?

1. **Completion Summaries**: Historical completion reports don't need to be in active directories
2. **Verification Reports**: Old verification snapshots are historical reference only
3. **Organization**: Better structure with completion summaries and verification reports in dedicated archive folders
