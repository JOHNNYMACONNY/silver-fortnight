# Performance Optimization for Large Datasets - Implementation Plan

## üéØ **OBJECTIVE**
Optimize application performance for handling large datasets efficiently, focusing on leaderboards, user directories, portfolio listings, and real-time data streams.

---

## **üìä CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### **Identified Performance Bottlenecks**

1. **Large Dataset Rendering**
   - User Directory: No virtualization for large user lists
   - Leaderboards: Limited pagination (50 items max)
   - Portfolio Items: No lazy loading or pagination
   - Real-time Updates: Potential memory leaks with large datasets

2. **Data Fetching Inefficiencies**
   - No request batching for multiple data sources
   - Missing query optimization for large result sets
   - Inefficient filtering and sorting on client-side
   - No data streaming for real-time updates

3. **Memory Management Issues**
   - Large datasets kept in memory without cleanup
   - No data compression for cached results
   - Missing memory usage monitoring
   - Potential memory leaks in real-time listeners

4. **Network Performance**
   - No request deduplication
   - Missing compression for API responses
   - No intelligent prefetching for related data
   - Inefficient real-time update broadcasting
