### **Frequency**
Quarterly (every 3 months)

### **Process Steps**

#### **Step 1: Placeholder Component Identification**
1. **Codebase Search**
   ```bash
   # Search for placeholder indicators
   grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|placeholder\|stub\|mock" src/
   grep -r "//.*not implemented\|//.*coming soon" src/
