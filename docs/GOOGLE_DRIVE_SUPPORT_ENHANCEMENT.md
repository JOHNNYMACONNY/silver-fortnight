# Google Drive Support Enhancement

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Feature**: Enhanced Google Drive Link Support for Trade Proposals

## Overview

Added comprehensive support for generic Google Drive file and folder links in the Evidence Embed System, expanding beyond the existing Google Docs/Sheets/Slides support to include all Google Drive file types and folder sharing.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Core Utilities (`src/utils/embedUtils.ts`)

Added two new service definitions to the `SUPPORTED_SERVICES` array:

#### Google Drive Files
- **Pattern**: Matches multiple URL formats
  - `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view`
  - `https://drive.google.com/open?id=FILE_ID`
  - `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID`
- **Embed Method**: iframe preview
- **Supports**: PDFs, images, videos, and any other file types stored in Google Drive

#### Google Drive Folders
- **Pattern**: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID`
- **Embed Method**: Embedded folder view
- **Supports**: Sharing entire folders with embedded file listings

### 2. UI Component Updates

#### EvidenceSubmitter (`src/components/features/evidence/EvidenceSubmitter.tsx`)
- **Updated**: Hint text to reflect expanded Google Drive support
- **New Text**: "Paste a link from YouTube, Google Drive (files & folders), Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, Imgur, etc."

#### EvidenceDemo (`src/components/features/evidence/EvidenceDemo.tsx`)
- **Added**: Two new entries in the Documents section:
  - Google Drive Files (drive.google.com/file)
  - Google Drive Folders (drive.google.com/drive/folders)

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### Main Evidence Documentation (`docs/EVIDENCE_EMBED_SYSTEM_CONSOLIDATED.md`)
- **Updated version**: 1.0 → 1.1
- **Added changelog section** documenting this enhancement
- **Updated supported services table** to include:
  - Google Drive Files: iframe embed for all file types
  - Google Drive Folders: iframe embed for folder views
- **Added comprehensive Google Drive URL formats section** explaining:
  - Google Workspace Documents (Docs/Sheets/Slides)
  - Generic Google Drive Files (3 URL format variations)
  - Google Drive Folders
  - Permission requirements
- **Enhanced user documentation** with clear instructions on sharing settings

## Technical Implementation

### URL Pattern Matching

```typescript
// Google Drive Files - supports multiple URL formats
{
  name: 'google-drive-file',
  pattern: /drive\.google\.com\/(?:file\/d\/|open\?id=|uc\?id=)([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/i,
  type: 'document',
  extractId: (url: string) => {
    const match = url.match(/drive\.google\.com\/(?:file\/d\/|open\?id=|uc\?id=)([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/i);
    return match ? match[1] : null;
  },
  generateEmbed: (id: string) => 
    `<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/${id}/preview" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`,
  generateThumbnail: undefined
}

// Google Drive Folders
{
  name: 'google-drive-folder',
  pattern: /drive\.google\.com\/drive\/folders\/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/i,
  type: 'document',
  extractId: (url: string) => {
    const match = url.match(/drive\.google\.com\/drive\/folders\/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/i);
    return match ? match[1] : null;
  },
  generateEmbed: (id: string) => 
    `<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/embeddedfolderview?id=${id}" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`,
  generateThumbnail: undefined
}
```

### Security Considerations

The existing Content Security Policy (CSP) already supports Google Drive embeds:
- **CSP includes**: `https://*.google.com` in frame-src
- **Covers**: drive.google.com, docs.google.com, and all other Google subdomains
- **No changes required**: Existing security rules are sufficient

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Created and ran `test-google-drive-support.js` to verify:
- ✅ Google Drive File URLs (all 3 formats) correctly match and extract IDs
- ✅ Google Drive Folder URLs correctly match and extract IDs
- ✅ Existing Google Docs/Sheets/Slides URLs still work
- ✅ Invalid URLs are properly rejected

### Test Results

All URL patterns successfully matched and extracted correct file/folder IDs:
- Standard format: `drive.google.com/file/d/ID/view` ✅
- Open format: `drive.google.com/open?id=ID` ✅
- Direct link: `drive.google.com/uc?id=ID` ✅
- Folder format: `drive.google.com/drive/folders/ID` ✅

## User Benefits

- ❌ Only Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides were supported
- ❌ Users couldn't share PDFs stored in Google Drive
