## 📈 Phase 2B.2 - Complete

### Added in 2B.2
- ✅ Login streak updates in auth/session flow (`markLoginDay` in `AuthContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Streak UI widgets:
  - Full: `src/components/features/StreakWidget.tsx` (tooltips, same‑day “Freeze used” badge, remaining freezes)
  - Compact: `src/components/features/StreakWidgetCompact.tsx`
- ✅ Milestone notifications + realtime toasts (`streak_milestone` via `emitGamificationNotification`)
- ✅ Streak configuration (`src/services/streakConfig.ts`): thresholds (`VITE_STREAK_THRESHOLDS`), max freezes (`VITE_STREAK_MAX_FREEZES`), user auto‑freeze preference (`localStorage` per‑uid)
- ✅ Gamification Dashboard:
  - “View streak details” link to History tab with Streaks panel

When crossing the goal for a given ISO week, an analytics event `weekly_goal_met` (via `useBusinessMetrics`) fires once and a lightweight toast reward is shown.
  - Opt‑in XP Breakdown (“See breakdown”)
- ✅ Challenges UX: Daily “Log practice” quick action (advances skill streak) and Base vs Bonus XP hint on cards
- ✅ Tests: auto‑freeze preference respected, practice logging, weekly goal persistence
