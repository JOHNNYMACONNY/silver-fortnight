2. **Simplify Provider Hierarchy**: Reduce complexity in the 9+ nested context providers in App.tsx
3. **Implement Design Patterns**: Introduce Repository, Factory, and Command patterns
4. **Improve Performance**: Optimize context re-renders and database queries
5. **Enhance Maintainability**: Reduce code duplication and improve separation of concerns

### Key Stakeholders

## Technical Specifications

### Current Architecture Issues

#### 1. Monolithic Database Service (`firestore.ts`)

- **Size**: 1,726 lines handling 9+ distinct domains
- **Complexity**: Functions averaging 50+ lines
- **Violations**: Multiple SOLID principle violations

#### 2. Provider Hell (`App.tsx`)

- **Nesting**: 9+ context providers creating dependency chains
- **Issues**: Circular dependencies, performance bottlenecks
- **Complexity**: 43 lazy-loaded components

### Target Architecture

#### 1. Domain-Driven Repository Pattern

```typescript
// Base Repository Interface
interface IRepository<T> {
  create(data: Omit<T, 'id'>): Promise<ServiceResult<string>>;
  getById(id: string): Promise<ServiceResult<T | undefined>>;
  getAll(filters?: FilterOptions<T>, pagination?: PaginationOptions): Promise<ServiceResult<PaginatedResult<T>>>;
  update(id: string, data: Partial<T>): Promise<ServiceResult<void>>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<ServiceResult<void>>;
}

// Domain-Specific Repositories
class UserRepository extends BaseRepository<User> implements IRepository<User>
class TradeRepository extends BaseRepository<Trade> implements IRepository<Trade>
class ProjectRepository extends BaseRepository<Project> implements IRepository<Project>
```

#### 2. Simplified Provider Architecture

```typescript
// Composite Provider Pattern
const CoreProviders = ({ children }) => (
  <AuthProvider>
    <DataProvider> {/* Combines User, Trade, Project providers */}
      <UIProvider> {/* Combines Theme, Toast, Notification providers */}
        <PerformanceProvider> {/* Unified performance monitoring */}
          {children}
        </PerformanceProvider>
      </UIProvider>
    </DataProvider>
  </AuthProvider>

## Maintenance & Support

### Troubleshooting Guides

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Repository Connection Issues**

```typescript
// Symptom: "Repository not found" errors
// Cause: Dependency injection not properly configured
// Solution: Verify service registration in DI container

// Check service registration
const container = new Container();
container.bind<IUserRepository>('UserRepository').to(UserRepository);
```

**Provider Performance Issues**

```typescript
// Symptom: Excessive re-renders
// Cause: Context value not properly memoized
// Solution: Use useMemo for context values

const contextValue = useMemo(() => ({
  users,
  actions: {
    createUser,
    updateUser,
    deleteUser
  }
}), [users, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser]);
```

**Circular Dependency Detection**

```bash
# Run dependency analysis
npx madge --circular src/

# Fix by extracting shared interfaces
# Create shared types package
# Use dependency injection
```

#### Performance Troubleshooting

**Slow Repository Operations**

1. Check Firestore query optimization
2. Verify indexing is properly configured
3. Check for N+1 query problems
4. Consider implementing caching layer

**Provider Render Issues**

1. Use React DevTools Profiler
2. Check context value stability
3. Implement React.memo where appropriate
4. Consider context splitting for performance

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /trades/{tradeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.creatorId == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.participantId == request.auth.uid);
