# Collaboration Roles System - Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Collaboration Roles System in TradeYa. The testing will validate role-based permissions, invitation flows, UI component integration, and end-to-end functionality.
