- Implement schema validation
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Create backups before major migrations

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query performance
- Track component render times
- Implement error logging
- Set up usage analytics

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Provide graceful degradation

- Create user-friendly error states
- Design system to work with partial feature availability

## Deployment Strategy

### Phased Rollout
- Deploy features incrementally
- Start with small user groups
- Gather feedback before wider release
- Monitor performance and errors closely

### Feature Branches
- Develop each feature in isolated branches
- Merge only when tests pass and code is reviewed
- Use pull requests for code review
- Maintain clean separation of concerns

### Staging Environment
- Test in staging before production
- Perform integration testing in staging
- Validate with real data (anonymized if needed)
- Simulate production load when possible

### Monitoring and Feedback
- Implement error tracking
- Collect user feedback
- Monitor performance metrics
- Be prepared to roll back if necessary

---

This master plan provides a structured approach to implementing all planned features while maintaining system stability and ensuring proper integration between components. By following this phased implementation strategy, we can deliver value incrementally while minimizing risk.

**Note:** This timeline is flexible and can be adjusted based on development velocity and changing priorities. Each feature can be broken down further into smaller tasks as implementation begins.
