## Implementation Approach

Our implementation approach follows these principles:

1. **Feature-First Development**: Each feature is developed as a cohesive unit with its own components, services, and tests.

2. **Incremental Delivery**: Features are broken down into smaller, deliverable increments that provide value.

3. **Documentation-Driven**: Detailed documentation is created before implementation to ensure clarity and alignment.

4. **Test-Driven**: Critical functionality is developed with tests to ensure reliability.

5. **User-Centered**: All features are designed with the user experience as the primary consideration.

## Documentation Structure

Implementation is guided by the following documentation:

- **IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md**: Overall implementation strategy and timeline
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md**: Tracking of implementation progress
- **IMPLEMENTATION_ENHANCEMENTS.md**: Guidelines for code style, component integration, and best practices
- **Feature-specific documentation**: Detailed requirements and technical specifications for each feature
