## Overview

The Trade Proposal System allows users to submit proposals to trades, including evidence of their previous work. The system integrates with the Evidence Embed System to handle the submission and display of evidence.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Firestore Permission Errors

**Problem**: Users were receiving "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors when trying to submit trade proposals. This was happening because:
- The security rules didn't properly handle the `tradeProposals` subcollection
- The rules didn't allow updating the `proposalCount` field on trade documents
- The rules didn't explicitly allow writing to nested subcollections

**Solution**: Updated Firestore security rules to:
- Add specific rules for the `tradeProposals` subcollection
- Allow authenticated users to update the `proposalCount` field on trade documents
- Add a general rule for all subcollections to ensure proper access

### 2. Evidence Submission UX Issues

**Problem**: When submitting evidence during the proposal process:
- The page would refresh after submitting evidence
- Users couldn't cancel the evidence form
- There was no visual feedback about submitted evidence

**Solution**:
- Changed the form element to a div to prevent form submission
- Changed the submit button to a regular button with an onClick handler
- Added a state variable to control the visibility of the evidence form
- Added a display section for submitted evidence
- Added the ability to remove evidence items

### 3. Content Security Policy Error

**Problem**: Avatar images from ui-avatars.com were being blocked by the Content Security Policy.

**Solution**: Updated the Content Security Policy in index.html to allow loading images from ui-avatars.com.

## Implementation Details

### Evidence Submitter Component

The EvidenceSubmitter component was modified to:
1. Use a div instead of a form element to prevent page refreshes
2. Use a button with onClick instead of a submit button
3. Support proper cancellation through the onCancel prop

```typescript
// Key changes in EvidenceSubmitter.tsx
return (
  <Card className={`p-4 ${className}`}>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Submit Evidence</h3>

    {/* Changed to div to prevent form submission */}
    <div className="evidence-form">
      {/* Form fields */}
      
      <Button
        type="button"
        variant="primary"
        onClick={(e) => handleSubmit(e as any)}
        disabled={isSubmitting || !url || !title || !description || !isValidEmbedUrl(url)}
      >
        {isSubmitting ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit Evidence'}
      </Button>
    </div>
  </Card>
);
```

### Trade Proposal Form

The TradeProposalForm was enhanced to:
1. Add a state variable to control the visibility of the evidence form
2. Display submitted evidence items
3. Allow removing evidence items
4. Show/hide the evidence form as needed

```typescript
// Key additions to TradeProposalForm.tsx
const [showEvidenceForm, setShowEvidenceForm] = useState<boolean>(true);

// Display submitted evidence
{portfolioEvidence.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-4">
    <h4 className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">
      Submitted Evidence ({portfolioEvidence.length})
    </h4>
    <div className="space-y-2 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 rounded-md p-3 mb-4">
      {portfolioEvidence.map((evidence, index) => (
        <div key={evidence.id} className="flex justify-between items-center p-2 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
          <div>
            <p className="font-medium">{evidence.title}</p>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">{evidence.embedService}</p>
          </div>
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => {
              const updatedEvidence = [...portfolioEvidence];
              updatedEvidence.splice(index, 1);
              setPortfolioEvidence(updatedEvidence);
            }}
            className="text-red-500 hover:text-red-700"
          >

        </div>
      ))}

)}

// Conditionally render the evidence form
{showEvidenceForm ? (
  <EvidenceSubmitter
    onSubmit={async (evidence) => {
      // Add the new evidence to the existing array
      const updatedEvidence = [...portfolioEvidence, evidence];
      setPortfolioEvidence(updatedEvidence);
      
      // Hide the form after successful submission
      setShowEvidenceForm(false);
      
      // Show success message
      console.log('Evidence added successfully:', evidence);
    }}
    onCancel={() => {
      // Close the evidence form by hiding it
      setShowEvidenceForm(false);
    }}
  />
) : (
  <button
    type="button"
    onClick={() => setShowEvidenceForm(true)}

    </svg>
    Add Evidence
  </button>
)}
```

### Content Security Policy Update

The Content Security Policy in index.html was updated to include ui-avatars.com:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
  style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline';
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  img-src 'self' https://i.imgur.com https://img.youtube.com https://i.vimeocdn.com https://res.cloudinary.com https://lh3.googleusercontent.com https://*.googleusercontent.com https://ui-avatars.com data: blob:;

  frame-src 'self' https://www.youtube.com https://player.vimeo.com;
  object-src 'none';
">
```

## Security Rules

The Firestore security rules were updated to properly handle the trade proposal system:

```
// Allow write access to all subcollections for authenticated users
match /{collection}/{document}/{subcollection}/{subdocument} {
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}

// Trades collection
match /trades/{tradeId} {
  // Anyone can read trades
  allow read: if true;
  // Authenticated users can create trades
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  // Only the trade owner can update or delete their trades, with an exception for proposal count updates
  allow update: if
    // Trade owner can update anything
    (request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId) ||
    // Any authenticated user can update only the proposalCount and updatedAt fields
    (request.auth != null &&
     request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['proposalCount', 'updatedAt']));
  // Only the trade owner can delete their trades
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;

  // Trade proposals subcollection
  match /tradeProposals/{proposalId} {
    // Anyone can read proposals
    allow read: if true;
    // Authenticated users can create proposals
    allow create: if request.auth != null;
    // Only the proposal creator can update or delete their proposals
    allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  }
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

To test the Trade Proposal System:

1. **Navigate to a trade detail page**
   - Click on any trade in the trades list

2. **Click "Submit Proposal"**
   - This should open the proposal form

3. **Fill out the proposal form**
   - Enter a message
   - Select timeframe and availability

4. **Add Evidence**
   - Click "Add Evidence" if the form is hidden
   - Fill out the evidence form with a valid URL, title, and description
   - Click "Submit Evidence"
   - The evidence should be added without navigating away
   - The evidence item should appear in the "Submitted Evidence" section
   - The evidence form should be hidden, showing an "Add Evidence" button

5. **Add Multiple Evidence Items**
   - Click "Add Evidence" again
   - Submit another piece of evidence
   - Verify both items appear in the list

6. **Remove Evidence**
   - Click the X button on an evidence item
   - Verify it's removed from the list

7. **Submit the Proposal**
   - Click "Submit Proposal"
   - Verify you're redirected to the trade detail page
   - Verify the proposal appears in the proposals list

## Future Improvements

1. **Toast Notifications**
   - Add success and error toasts for evidence submission
   - Add toasts for proposal submission

2. **Evidence Preview**
   - Add a preview of the evidence in the list
   - Improve the styling of the evidence items

3. **Form Validation**
   - Add more robust validation for evidence URLs
   - Add validation for proposal fields

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Ensure the evidence form works well on mobile devices
   - Optimize the proposal form for small screens

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement pagination for proposals
   - Optimize evidence loading

6. **Integration with Trade Confirmation System**
   - Connect the proposal system with the trade confirmation flow
