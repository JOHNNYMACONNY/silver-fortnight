type SimpleRole = 'Leader' | 'Contributor' | 'Helper';

// Maps to complex backend roles
const ROLE_MAPPING = {
  'Leader': [CollaborationRole.OWNER, CollaborationRole.ADMIN],
  'Contributor': [CollaborationRole.MEMBER], 
  'Helper': [CollaborationRole.VIEWER]
};
```

### Progressive Disclosure

- **Beginner View**: Simple cards with clear next actions
- **Advanced View**: Full CollaborationRole complexity for power users
- **Toggle**: Users can switch between views as they gain experience

### Smart Automation

- **Auto Role Assignment**: AI suggests optimal roles based on user profile
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-filled project templates
- **Next Action Guidance**: Clear, context-aware action buttons

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. Component Architecture

#### Simple Collaboration Dashboard

```typescript
// Main dashboard with view toggle
<SimpleCollaborationDashboard>
  {!showAdvanced ? (
    <SimpleProjectGrid projects={projects} />
  ) : (
    <AdvancedProjectView projects={projects} />
  )}
</SimpleCollaborationDashboard>
```

#### Challenge Progression Flow

```typescript
// Three-tier navigation
<ChallengeProgressionDashboard>
  <ProgressionHeader progress={userProgress} />
  <TierNavigation progress={userProgress} />
  <RecommendedChallenges challenges={recommendations} />
</ChallengeProgressionDashboard>
```

### 2. Backend Services

#### Simplified Collaboration Functions

```typescript
// Create simple collaboration hiding backend complexity
createSimpleCollaboration(idea, skillsNeeded, maxPeople, creatorId)

// Get user's collaborations in simplified format  
getUserSimpleCollaborations(userId): SimpleCollaborationCard[]

// Smart role assignment
joinCollaborationWithSmartRole(collabId, userId, preferredRole?)
```

#### Challenge Progression Tracking

```typescript
// Track user progress across all three tiers
getUserChallengeProgress(userId): UserChallengeProgress

// Smart challenge recommendations
recommendNextChallenge(user): Challenge[]
```

### 3. Database Schema Enhancements

#### Three-Tier Challenge Support

```typescript
interface Challenge {
  type: 'SOLO' | 'TRADE' | 'COLLABORATION';
  soloConfig?: SoloChallengeConfig;
  tradeConfig?: TradeChallengeConfig; 
  collaborationConfig?: CollaborationChallengeConfig;
}
```

#### Simplified Role Storage

```typescript
// Store both simple and complex role mappings
interface UserRole {
  userId: string;
  simpleRole: SimpleCollaborationRole;
  complexRoles: CollaborationRole[];
  assignedAt: Timestamp;
}
```
