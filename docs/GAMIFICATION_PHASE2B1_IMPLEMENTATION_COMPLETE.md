## Critical Integration Points

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT MODIFY

These integration points are critical for Phase 2B.1 functionality:

#### **1. Admin Detection System**
```typescript
// In src/AuthContext.tsx
const ADMIN_UIDS = ['admin-uid-1', 'admin-uid-2'];
const ADMIN_EMAILS = ['admin@tradeya.com', 'developer@tradeya.com'];

const checkIsAdmin = (user: User): boolean => {
  return ADMIN_UIDS.includes(user.uid) || 
         (user.email && ADMIN_EMAILS.includes(user.email));
};
```

#### **2. Leaderboard Service Integration**
```typescript
// In src/services/leaderboards.ts
export const getLeaderboardData = async (
  category: LeaderboardCategory,
  period: LeaderboardPeriod,
  limit: number = 10
): Promise<LeaderboardData>
```

#### **3. Navigation Integration**
```tsx
// In src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx and MobileMenu.tsx
<Link to="/leaderboard" className="nav-link">
  <Trophy className="icon" />
  Leaderboard
</Link>
```

#### **4. Route Configuration**
```tsx
// In src/App.tsx
<Route path="/leaderboard" element={<LeaderboardPage />} />
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change Prevention

- Never remove the leaderboard route or navigation items
- Maintain backward compatibility for leaderboard data structures
- Preserve admin detection logic for future admin features
- Keep existing gamification service APIs unchanged
