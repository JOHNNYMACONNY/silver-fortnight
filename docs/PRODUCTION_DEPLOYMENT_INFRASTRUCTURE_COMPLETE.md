## 🚀 Production Deployment Commands

### Quick Start - Full Automated Deployment

```bash
# Complete production deployment (recommended)
npm run production:deploy

# Dry run for testing (safe)
npm run production:deploy:dry-run

# Force deployment without manual approval (use with caution)
npm run production:deploy:force
```

### Step-by-Step Manual Control

```bash
# 1. Pre-flight validation
npm run production:pre-flight-check

# 2. Environment setup
npm run production:env-setup

# 3. Start monitoring
npm run production:monitoring:start

# 4. Phased migration (manual control)
npm run production:migration:10-percent
# Monitor and verify, then continue...
npm run production:migration:50-percent
# Monitor and verify, then continue...
npm run production:migration:full

# 5. Post-migration validation
npm run production:post-migration-validation
```

### Emergency Procedures

```bash
# Emergency rollback
npm run production:rollback:emergency --reason="Critical error detected"

# Start rollback monitoring
npm run production:rollback:start

# Kill switch (immediate stop)
kill -USR1 <deployment_process_pid>
```

## 🔒 Safety Mechanisms

### 1. **Automatic Rollback Triggers**

- **Error Rate**: >5% automatically triggers rollback
- **Health Score**: <70 triggers immediate rollback
- **Response Time**: >5 seconds sustained triggers rollback
- **Data Integrity**: Any compromise triggers emergency rollback

### 2. **Manual Safety Controls**

- **Manual Approval**: Required for production deployments
- **Emergency Stop**: SIGUSR1 signal for immediate shutdown
- **Phase Confirmation**: Manual approval between migration phases
- **Rollback Override**: Manual rollback trigger at any time

### 3. **Performance Protection**

- **Baseline Monitoring**: Continuous performance baseline validation
- **Throughput Protection**: Minimum 50 ops/sec maintained
- **Latency Protection**: Sub-5ms normalization time enforced
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory and CPU usage tracking

### 4. **Data Protection**

- **Pre-Migration Backup**: Automatic backup before deployment
- **Real-Time Validation**: Continuous data integrity checks
- **Schema Compatibility**: Backward compatibility validation
- **Rollback Testing**: Pre-validated rollback procedures

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks
