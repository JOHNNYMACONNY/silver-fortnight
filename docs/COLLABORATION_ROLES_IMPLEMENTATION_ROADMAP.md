- State management with React Context

### System Dependencies

- Evidence Embed System must be fully implemented
- Notification System must be operational
- User Profile System must support additional data

### External Dependencies

- Firebase Firestore for data storage
- Firebase Authentication for user identification
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks

1. **Data Migration Complexity**
   - **Risk Level**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of migration scripts on development data before production deployment

2. **Performance with Large Collaborations**
   - **Risk Level**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination for applications, optimize queries, and use subcollections

3. **User Experience Complexity**
   - **Risk Level**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct user testing early, focus on clear status indicators and intuitive flows

4. **Integration Challenges**
   - **Risk Level**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Define clear interfaces between systems, use consistent patterns from Trade Lifecycle System

### Contingency Plans

1. **Phased Rollout**: If issues arise, implement a phased rollout starting with basic functionality
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable/disable specific features if problems occur
3. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert to simple role structure if necessary

## Success Criteria

The Collaboration Roles System implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - All planned features are implemented and working correctly
   - All user flows are complete and intuitive
   - Integration with existing systems is seamless

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Database queries complete in under 500ms
   - UI interactions are responsive (under 100ms)
   - System handles collaborations with 10+ roles and 50+ applications

3. **User Experience**
   - Users can easily create roles with detailed requirements
   - Application process is straightforward and intuitive
   - Collaboration creators can effectively manage roles and applications
   - Role status and progress are clearly visible

4. **Code Quality**
   - All components have unit tests with >80% coverage
