**There is ZERO hesitation.** The system is production-ready and will provide an excellent user experience.

**Remaining work:**
- ⏳ Firestore indexes building (auto-completes, non-blocking)
- ⏳ CDN cache on tradeya.io (auto-clears, non-blocking)

**None of these affect core functionality or user experience.**
